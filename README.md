## Design

### Colour Scheme

As climbing gyms are a very colourful environment due to the holds used to set the routes, I didnt want to have a bland set of colours. So while playing with some colours i decided on a shade of blue/green called Persian Green, a darker shade of that colour Sherpa Blue, also a shade of off-white called Alabaster and a highlight colour or Fuzzy Wuzzy Brown (which is a shade of pink) 

* I have used `#fafafa` & `#00aaaa` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites headers, footers, text and background colours.
* I have used `#005555` as the shadows and index.html text colour.
* I have used `#c65465` as a background colour (i have reduced the opacity of the pink using rbga valuse) also as minor decoration through out the site.

* [SherpaBlue](https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/005555)


### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Mulish]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&family=Space+Mono:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap'). Mulish is a sans-serif font which features a clean and contemporary design that enhances readability, making it easy for users to consume content on the screen, easpecially when used for all headers in the site.

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Space-Mono]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&family=Space+Mono:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap'). Space Mono is alos a sans-serif font meaning it has high legibility, also a monospaced typeface which also aids readability. I also thought it partnered well with the Mulish font.

### Imagrey 

I wanted acsess to the highest quality pictures available to gove the site a polsihed feel, so I used Adobe's Stock images for this project. I selected the images based on a number of key criteria. 
* one, to make sure there were a wide range of different people, from gender to race and age
* two, that all images had the person or group of people enjoying them selves and were smiling / happy

### Features 

The website is comprised of a home page, a sessions page and a get started page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have a favicon in the browser tab. 

#### The Home page

the home page of the come climbing site containsa a title and function navigation bar and footer with social media links. It also contains information about the site, how and where we operate, and who the site is catered for.

#### The sessions page

the sessions page contains the same header and footer elements. Its main function though is to show site users when, where, at what time and how long the sessions we are runnning are. Included in that is a link to google maps showing the location of each climbing gym we use.

#### The Lets get Started Page 

this is where users come to sign up to the sessions we hold. it also contains the smae footer, header and nav bar links as the other pages

#### future implementations

in the future i would like tio bew able to add to the lets get started form an option to select the exact meet you want to come to. 
i would also like to add more dates to the sessions page so that the site doesnt need to be updated a frequently as it does now.
